This is all about GAN, its variants and some interesting projects with them. So.. let's start..

# Generative Adversarial Network
### in short : Generative Advarsarial Networks, GANs are a type of Neural Network Architecture that could generate real like data.
 
  GANs were introduced in 2014, by [Ian Goodfellow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-goodfellow-b7187213/) and other researchers at the University of Montreal, including [Yoshua Bengio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yoshuabengio) in their paper [Generative Adversarial Nets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf).
  GAN is just an awesome idea, in which we simultaneously train two models. One aganist the other!!
  One of the models is called the **Discriminator** whose role is to distinguish between the real and the fake(or generated). And the other model **Generator**, is meant to generate data that seems real and are good enough to be classified as real by the Discriminator.
